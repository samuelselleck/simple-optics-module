# About

Online open source optics tool for experimenting and teaching geometrical optics. The project was developed after the original desktop sofware (https://openopticsmodule.com) was starting to become more feature rich, to fill the need for a more easily acessible tool with intuitive controls. The project is found at: https://simple.openopticsmodule.com/.
